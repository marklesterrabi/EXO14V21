EXO14V21: AN SMART CANE NAVIGATOR DEVICE FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED

The idea of this project is based on a well-known biblical story in Exodus 14:21. In which an obedient servant of God named “Moses”, parting the Red Sea to escape the pursuing Egyptian army. The power of God revealed across the world through Moses and through the help of empowered cane that God has given to him. 

In this project the researchers plan to develop a Smart Cane Navigator Device which can possible help people who are visually impaired. The possible sensors that we may use are the following including PIR Motion Sensor, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and Light Sensor. With the motion sensor it detects movements, nearby people and objects. Ultrasonic sensors can detect the distance between a variety of objects, independent of their shape, color, or texture. They may also determine if an item is coming or retreating. And the last sensor is Light Sensor, which tells if it is dark or bright in a place.

The objective of this project is to create a smart blind stick that is equipped with a variety of sensors and buzzers. Smart stick that generates a buzzing sound when it identifies objects or walls from a distance of one or half meter. A blind person can use this Smart Stick to detect the presence of a barrier or a wall in front. The individual will then be alerted to an upcoming obstruction or barrier using PIR Motion Sensor. The light sensor will send notification to the user about the current light status of the location.
